# YouTube Auto Like

Never forget to like a video again.

**Feb 2021: Sadly, Chrome removed this extension for violating [YouTube's terms of service](https://www.youtube.com/t/terms) (specifically the part about causing inaccurate measurements of user engagement). You can still load the extension locally by following these steps. Only do this for extensions you trust.**

1. Download the latest release: https://github.com/austencm/youtube-auto-like/releases/latest/download/release.zip
2. Unzip `release.zip` and put it somewhere it won't get deleted accidentally
3. Open your extensions page in Chrome (in the top right, click the <img width="18" height="18" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/5nlvcUtFevZLAkSJALBl5Fa8thP_-mGFnUngJLuAFzt0jws-Lr09I9mIfawW4vKiT6k=w36-h36" alt="puzzle piece"> icon, then "Manage Extensions" (at the bottom of the popup)
4. Turn on Developer Mode (in the top right)
5. Click 'Load unpacked' and select the unzipped `release` folder
6. Set your options again (sorry, the browser thinks it's a new extension and options get reset. I don't have a good way around this.)

Extensions loaded this way are unable to update automatically. Keep an eye out for a badge on the icon that indicates a new version is available.
